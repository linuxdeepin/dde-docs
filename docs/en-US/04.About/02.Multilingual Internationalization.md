## How to do internationalization?

Under `/docs/docs/` path, the default language is Chinese (`zh`); you can follow the corresponding folder below and put the translated documents in the folder, if you want it to be other languages, you can refer to `en-US` folder structure to create a new one.

```bash
.
├── 01.DTK
├── 02. Experience sharing
├── 03.Community works
├── 04.About
├─ en-US
│ ├── 01.DTK
│ ├── 02.Experience Sharing
│ ├── 03.Community creations
│ └── 04.About 
└── README.md
```

### **Note**

Both folder and file names must be preceded by a number, e.g. `01.xxxx` or `01.xxxx.md`, with xxx being the specific name, where `. `, otherwise the parsing will fail. The preceding numbers can be discontinuous and are only used in the order in which the left-hand navigation bar is finally generated.

## Other

Chinese is the default language for now, and will be switched to English when the number of English exceeds the number of Chinese (committed to internationalization).

Thanks to everyone who submitted a contribution in any language.
