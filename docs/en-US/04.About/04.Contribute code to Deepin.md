## Contribute code to Deepin

**How do I contribute code to `Deepin|UOS`? **

`fork` [linuxdeepin](https://github.com/linuxdeepin) inside the repository and submit `Pull Requests`. 

<br>

<font size="5" color="red"> **Note the Commit specification:**Â </font>

### External commits to the `Commit` format for `Pull requests`:

Third parties or individuals (including insiders), submitting contributions, need to follow the same internal `commit` format.

***Note: Because the format of gerrit, please submit with one pull request map to one commit, if you have numbers of commits, you should create more pull request***
<br>

### Standard:

```bash
title (mandatory, not blank: brief summary title)

Description (mandatory, not blank: detailed description)

Log: (Compulsory, can be empty (not recommended): will be used by the internal crp system, do not know how to fill in, just repeat the title content)
Bug: (Optional, can be empty: connect for bug)
Issue: (Optional, can be empty: fixed issuse link)
Task: (Optional, can be empty: Task link, external parties not available)
```

<br>

### Example: 

 [see link](https://github.com/linuxdeepin/dtkgui/commit/de1f742edefee47963515acf63721ffb53193a8b) 

```bash
fix: Fix default display right angle

A call to `FETCH_PROPERTY("DTK/WindowRadius", windowRadius)` will return -1 by default, resulting in the right angle parameter. So the cup is fixed here.

Log:
```

<br>

> PS: The above is a demonstration of the simplest submission, note that
>
> 1. title preferably preceded by modifiers: `fix: `, `docs: `, `feat: ` and so on 
> 2. where blank lines are essential (`title` `detail` `Log:` should have blank lines between them, `L` should be capitalized, English colon)
> 3. `Log: ` The initial letter of this line must be capitalized, and an English colon is indispensable, and the rest of the line can be left unwritten.



If you do not submit according to this specification, the bot `bot` will be judged as minus `-2` (for `Deepin` employees as well) and will not be merged; for missing parts, the bot will fill them in automatically.
