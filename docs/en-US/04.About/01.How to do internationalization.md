- **Create a `Markdown` file and name it in the following format**

Just put your article, with a prefix number, like `01.xxxxxxx.md`, into the corresponding folder. There must be no `. ` or else the parsing will fail. (The `01` serial number only serves as the left side of the directory order, not consecutive)

```bash
.
├── 01.DTK
├── 02. Experience sharing
├── 03.Community Works
├── 04.About
├─ en-US
│ ├── 01.DTK
│ ├── 02.Experience Sharing

└── README.md
```

## Generate table headers for markdown (with permanent links)

- Clone the project `https://github.com/linuxdeepin/docs.git`
- Compile environment: `nmp install`
- Project preview: `npm run docs:dev` (will automatically generate `front matter` and permalink for `Markdown`)

<br>

**PS:** Delete the header and re-run `npm run docs:dev` to regenerate the links. It is recommended to use `cnpm` instead of `npm` in mainland China
