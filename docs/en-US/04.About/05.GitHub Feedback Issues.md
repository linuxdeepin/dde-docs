## Give feedback to Deepin Issues

### How can I give feedback to `Deepin|UOS`, report a bug, or make some suggestions?

In [linuxdeepin](https://github.com/linuxdeepin) for the corresponding repository, just submit `Issues` as normal; this is where Deepin looks for issues and defects, and where you can communicate with others to try to resolve them yourself.



<font size="4" color="red">**We recommend to keep it short and concise, with detailed environment and steps to reproduce, just describe clearly, so that the test lady can reproduce the problem easily;**</font>



Recommend English communication about `Issues` (currently common repository) will automatically `bot` @ relevant people.
