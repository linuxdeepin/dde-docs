## Why this project?

A good project should be accompanied by documentation as a reference for those who come after it.

Not limited to `DTK` documentation, but also as a place for users to show their work and experience. Build the `Deepin` community documentation.

<br>

## Deepin community documentation location?

- `DTK documentation`: documentation of the DTK library maintainer's experience, and some experience with application developers
- `Experience sharing`: the use of Deepin, applications, tools in the process of trolling, their own experience in the treadmill to share
- `Community works`: the development experience and works of individual developers in the community (contributions are welcome, we suggest you indicate the original address of the article)

<br>

## About internationalization?

Take Chinese as, then translate to other languages; all cuties who are willing to help us with internationalization help are welcome.

Of course, you can also have the English version first, and then the articles in other languages.

<br>

## Acknowledgements

We hope to build a great `DTK` document, and welcome any and all peeps who contribute or help manage this document.
